#Python Task Manager 

## About the Project
This project is a CLI-based task manager focused on priorities and time distribution.  
It is designed for people who want not only to complete tasks, but also to understand **how their attention and energy are distributed throughout the day**.

## Idea
The project is planned as part of a larger life-gamification concept.  
Unlike traditional todo lists, tasks here are not treated as equal: each task contributes to the overall “daily efficiency” depending on its importance.

Tasks are assigned to categories with predefined percentage weights. Completing tasks fills an efficiency bar proportionally to their importance, making it possible to clearly track how well daily activities align with personal priorities.
